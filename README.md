# Python Dutch Weather data visualization

### This is a project for self educational purposes using python

The data for the weather and station nummer are in the data/data.rar. 

Because of the huge size of the weather data I had to zip it to upload it to the repository.  
The data csv is from KMNI and and contain weather data from the year 1901 - 2018
